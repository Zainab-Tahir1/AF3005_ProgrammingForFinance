# **AF3005 Programming for Finance - Assignment 1**

## **Smart Financial Management System**

This repository contains the implementation of a **Smart Financial Management System** developed for SecureBank. The system is designed to automate various financial operations using Python and `ipywidgets` for interactive user input. The implementation is divided into five parts, each addressing a specific financial task.

---

## **Features**

The system includes the following features:

1. **Loan Eligibility & Interest Rate Calculation**  
   - Checks if a customer is eligible for a loan based on employment status, income, and credit score.
   - Calculates the applicable interest rate or rejects the loan application.

2. **Investment Risk Assessment**  
   - Evaluates a portfolio of stocks and classifies the risk level based on stock returns.

3. **Loan Repayment Tracker**  
   - Tracks the remaining loan balance as monthly payments are made until the loan is fully repaid.

4. **Stock Price Monitoring and Trading Strategy**  
   - Monitors stock prices daily and triggers an alert when the price reaches a target value.

5. **Currency Exchange Rate Tracker**  
   - Tracks the PKR/USD exchange rate daily and stops when the rate reaches a target value.

## **Requirements**

To run the code, you need the following:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **ipywidgets** library (install using `pip install ipywidgets`)

## **Implementation Details**

### **Part 1: Loan Eligibility & Interest Rate Calculation**
- Uses `ipywidgets` to collect user input for employment status, income, and credit score.
- Implements conditional logic to determine loan eligibility and interest rates.

### **Part 2: Investment Risk Assessment**
- Takes a list of stock returns as input and classifies the portfolio risk level.
- Uses loops and conditional statements to evaluate the returns.

### **Part 3: Loan Repayment Tracker**
- Simulates loan repayment by deducting monthly payments from the loan balance.
- Displays the remaining balance after each payment.

### **Part 4: Stock Price Monitoring and Trading Strategy**
- Iterates through a list of stock prices and skips missing data (`None` values).
- Triggers an alert when the stock price reaches the target value.

### **Part 5: Currency Exchange Rate Tracker**
- Tracks the PKR/USD exchange rate daily and stops when the rate reaches the target value.
